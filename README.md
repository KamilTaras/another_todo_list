# another_todo_list

This is a small project about **toDo list**, which I make in **Flutter**
Even thought it is simple project, it gives me a lot of fun to make.

The idea of this app is simple. We have **3 categories** of tasks:
- to do
- in progress
- done

But it is designed the way that users will be able to easily add their own pages in the future

## What changed since last update?

Now the code is cleaner. I've made it more generic and significantly reduced repetitions. Many elements are now easily reusable for future pages.
Material Design 3 has now been integrated into the app :) 

## What am I going to change?
**For sure I want to:**

- allow user to change position of the task within the list
- add button which will allow user to delete only checked tasks
- fix bug where now it is impssible to check task, as I plan to redefine a little bit the way of managment of state it was easier for now disable it.
