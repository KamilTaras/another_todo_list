# another_todo_list

This is a small project about **toDo list**, which I make in **Flutter**
Even thought it is simple project, it gives me a lot of fun to make.

The idea of this app is simple. We have** 3 categories** of tasks:
- to do
- in progress
- done

## What am I going to change?
**For sure I want to:**
- Make code more generic, to add also inProgress and done pages
- allow user to change category of the task by swiping cards with tasks
- allow user to change position of the task within the list
- add button which will allow user to delete only checked tasks

  
## What I did already?
